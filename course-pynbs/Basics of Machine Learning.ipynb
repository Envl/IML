    "# Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning has become recently a hot topic present in scientific literature as well as in the general public literature. Roughly saying, machine learning is *way* for computer to learn from data, and consequently, has been  at the heart of artificial intelligence algorithms. ML is nowadays already in many of the products we use Today from recommendation systems able to provide personnalized recommendations for filems (Netflix), music (Apple Music) or more general products (Amazon). Machine learning is also widely used to filters our spam, to recognise voice in personnal assistants, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "A formal definition of **machine learning** (ML) can be: a set of methods that can **automatically detect patterns** in data, and then use the uncovered patterns to **predict future data** (*from Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective (Murphy 2012)*)\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"ml_types\"></a>\n",
    "## Types of learning\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the types of \"learning\"? In ML literature, there are several types of learning, the three main types are: supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "In supervised learning, you have access to a dataset where each datapoint, considered as an *input*, has an associated known output, that can be discrete (like a *label*) or continuous. The goal of a supervised learning algorithm is to learn the relationship between the inputs and their associated outputs. In case the outputs are discrete (*labels*) we call the task **classification**, in case the outputs are continous, the task is called **regression**. \n",
    "\n",
    "In unsupervised learning, you have acess to a dataset where there are only *inputs* (datapoints without associated labels or some values). The goal of an unsupervised learning algorithm is then to infer from these data the underlying structure. This task is usually harder than supervised learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning is a different paradigm: the learning occurs through interaction with the environment. In reinforcement learning, an agent takes actions in an environment such as to maximize some cumulative rewards. Each action taken produces a reward that the agent takes into account in order to assess the \"quality\" of the action. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"ml_phases\"></a>\n",
    "## Phases\n",
    "\n",
    "In ML, we usually consider two phases: **learning** then **testing**. **Training** an algorithm in machine learning means detecting patterns in a dataset. **Testing** an algorithm means predicting future data, that is generalizing the uncovered trained patterns to new datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"ml_python\"></a>\n",
    "## Machine Learning in Python\n",
    "\n",
